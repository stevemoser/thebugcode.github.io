We have a new, fast and free website in that order. The Code Bug was about to spend a fortune on a fast WordPress website when he realised you can get an even faster one for free. <br>
We're hosted on GitHub and the site is small so it loads super fast. The code bug likes ultra-fast sites. He thinks your time is important.</p>

<h3 id="sowhatcanthecodebugsnewsitedo">So what can the code Bug's new site do?</h3>

<p>Here's how the Code Bug creates a new post now:  </p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ octopress new post "Post Title"
$ git add .
$ git commmit -m "New Post"
$ git push origin
</code></pre>

<p>Now that's cool even if you didn't get it. <br>
Also, now you can see the estimated read time at the top. A nice touch.</p>

<h3 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can pretend the Code Bug is quoting people he never actually read.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="codesnippets">Code Snippets</h2>

<p>Syntax highlighting Swift code as if it were javascript. But hey, it works</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">class SwiftClass {  
    func foo() {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>

<p>And cute buttons. If you want to get a site like this one for free then tap the button and follow the instructions.</p>

<div markdown="0"><a href="http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/theme-setup/" class="btn btn-success">I want a fast blog as well</a></div>

<p>At the end of the page we have disqus comments. Feel free to never use them, and when you do, insult as many people as you can</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
